\
## Pre-requisites\
Before you can run this project, you'll need to have the following packages installed on your system:\
\
- Python (version 3.11 or above)\
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)\
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\
\
You can install these packages using pip:\

pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib\
```\
\
## Files in this Folder  \
This folder \'93EDA\'94 includes:  \
- this README file\
- a folder named "Data and Program" that contains the python script "EDA.py\'94 and one .csv file named \'93census-income.data.csv\'94.\
\
## Compilation\
There is no compilation step. Since Python is an interpreted language we will only need to run the Python script.\
\
## How to Run the Python Script\
\
You can run this Python script in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) by doing the following:\
\
1. Open your IDE of choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, etc.).\
\
2. Using your IDE, create a new project.\
\
3. Copy the entire folder \'93EDA\'94 to the folder of your new project.\
\
4. To run \'93EDA.py\'94, locate and open the script file in the "Data and Program" folder with your IDE; run the program using your IDE.\
\
5. Ensure all packages mentioned are installed, if not, install using pip in the IDE terminal. You may copy and enter the code below in your IDE terminal:\
\
```bash\
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib\
```\
